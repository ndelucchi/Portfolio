# Nick's Portfolio
Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here, I document a summary of my projects in the data field.

# Machine Learning

| Project Link | Area  | Project Descrption | Tools |
| :----------- | :---- | :----------------- | :---- |
| Credit Card Fraud Detection |  Imbalanced Data, Data Pipeline, MLOps,  Machine Learning  |  This project is a modular, production-ready Credit Card Fraud Detection pipeline leveraging XGBoost and systematic RFECV to address the challenge of highly imbalanced financial data. The workflow includes rigorous feature engineering, is optimized using the F2 score, and features a tuned prediction threshold to ensure maximum recall and minimized financial loss.   | scikit-learn, imblearn, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, scipy, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn |
| Toxic Community Analysis | NLP, Imbalanced Data, Data Mining, Classification | This project is an end-to-end NLP pipeline for community toxicity analysis, utilizing TF-IDF and a highly accurate deep learning or ensemble classification model trained on vast comment data. The solution demonstrates production readiness by integrating Selenium and the YouTube API to scrape live community data, pre-process it, and provide a single, quantitative metric on overall toxicity for content moderation insight. | TF-IDF, imblearn, scikit-learn, keras, Tensorflow, selenium, requests, pandas, numpy, matplotlib |
| Heart Disease Identification | Small Data, Medical Data, Feature Engineering, Classification| This project applies various supervised machine learning techniques, including XGBoost and Random Forests, to a clinical dataset to predict the presence of heart disease. The analysis rigorously identifies the most impactful diagnostic features—such as max heart rate and chest pain type—to create a minimal, high-accuracy prediction model suitable for early screening. | XGBoost, RandomForest, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib|
| Authorial Distinction | NLP, Clustering, Classification | This project conducts a rigorous comparative analysis of NLP vectorization techniques, evaluating Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF methods for their efficacy in distinguishing between different literary authors. The analysis applies both supervised classifiers (like Logistic Regression and Random Forest) and unsupervised clustering techniques (like K-Means) to determine the superior modeling approach for authorial distinction.| nltk, spacy, re, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib |
| Crime Model Validation | Model Evaluation & Validation | This project develops a multivariable regression model using 2013 New York crime statistics to predict future crime rates, with an emphasis on model validation and generalization. The model's strong predictive stability is rigorously confirmed by assessing its performance against an entirely independent 2014 crime dataset, showcasing a reliable approach to time-based forecasting and validation. | scikit-learn, pandas, numpy,  matplotlib |
